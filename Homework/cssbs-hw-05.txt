***1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?***
Compound assignment operator combine simple assignment operator with another binary operator

***2. List all the compound assignment operators.***
*=
/=
%=
+=
-=

***3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.***
+=5;  -=50;
var= var + 5; /var= var - 50;

***4. How long does a while loop run?***
As long as the condition is true or you run out of memory

***5. What is an iteratiion variable? (Not in book)***
It is a variable that stores a portion o the iterable when a for loop is being executed

***6. What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?***

The program will run forever creating an infinite loop


***7. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of
them? What happens if you omit all of them?***
There are 3 parts to a for loop (initalization, Boolean expression and code that updates the control variable)
Yes you can omit any of the 3



***8. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?***
A do while statement guarantees that a loop runs at least once.

***9. What does the break statement do?***
Break statement caused the loop to terminate.

***10. What does the continue statement do?***
the continue statement causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop
 immediately (after reevaluating the Boolean expression)

***11. (Thought question) Can you think of any reason why you would want to have an infinite loop? ***
An “infinite loop” is a loop without an update variable that in effect runs forever. As you will see, these kinds of loops are written intentionally to perform various kinds of tasks.
